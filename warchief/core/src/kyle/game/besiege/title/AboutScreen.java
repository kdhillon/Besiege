            "seeks to respect the memory of the millions of indigenous people who died and suffered in one of the" +
            " greatest " + "tragedies in the history of humankind. Before 1492, North America was home to thousands " +
            "of societies and" + " some of the largest cities and empires in the world. But in the following " +
            "centuries, waves of " + "horrifying European diseases ravaged the hemisphere, destroying families, " +
            "villages, and entire nations. " + "At the same time, groups of Europeans brutalized, enslaved, and " +
            "committed acts of genocide on the " + "indigenous people who survived. We will never know the full scale" +
            " of human suffering that was caused, " + "because countless societies, cultures, languages, and " +
            "histories were lost forever. \n" + "\n" + "Warchief is based on the vibrant and dynamic continent " +
            "before this tragedy. It blends historical " + "sources with myths, legends and belief systems. Now, Iâ€™m " +
            "neither a historian nor an expert in mythology." + " With Warchief, I wanted to try to reconstruct a " +
            "rough picture of what it would be like to lead a " + "warband, army or empire in this often overlooked " +
            "period of history.\n" + "\n" + "Unfortunately, there is" + " a frustrating lack of primary sources " +
            "describing exactly what life and war were like before the " + "introduction of European diseases, guns, " +
            "horses, and metallurgy to the continent. Historians combine archaeological evidence with first-hand " +
            "accounts by early Europeans to paint a rough picture. I used several such sources when researching for " +
            "this game. Where there were holes," + " I filled them with my imagination. Therefore, like all " +
            "historical works, this game will include biases " + "and inaccuracies. I apologize in advance for these." +
            " That said, I hope Warchief serves its purpose of " + "transporting the player to one of the most " +
            "beautiful, complex and fascinating places in world history. \n\n - Kyle Dhillon";
