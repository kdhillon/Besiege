Gameplay:

control a party on the map. 
Party screen/window contains info about who is in your party, upgrades, etc.
Character screen/window contains player info.

Various armies move around the map.
Each army has a "target," destination. Move in path towards that destination at given speed.
If army's destination is another Army or City, and distance to that army is <= .01 or some small number, triggers an interaction.
How to store all armies? in a bag? or table?

clicking on the map moves your party towards that spot.
party speed is calculated based on party size and character upgrades



  /|
 / |
/__| o = tan-1(y/x)

x = Dcos(o)
y = Dsin(o)


base speed + morale/100 + 1/party size

    tips: 
use object pooling for Armies (allows reuse and efficient memory use)
when drawing background image, disable blending!
CLEAR SCREEN EACH FRAME
use Sprite class for armies. So useful for kingdomRotation/stretching.
use MapRenderer interface for maps?
or perhaps scene2d makes the most sense for this type of game (actors and stage!)
^definitely makes the most sense (actions, draws all together, etc)

later:
eventually use clipping for minimap!
use distancefield for fonts

tuning up later:
    check maxSpritesInBatch (int) field of Batch after running the program and set max to that number

Day 47: improved A* pathfinding, optimized visibility graph to 1/4 previous size (now 1/10)
Day 48: worked on running and coordinating pathfinding with army, reduced freezing
Day 49:


now:
add partyCAp for nobles and player
add castles

later:
change "back" button to use a stack
make party speed affect retreat and regroup speed
implement army repairing based on wealth
add population?
add resting - in cities and outside - for player and others.
think about natural occurances that can benefit or hurt you
 - forests, deserts, mountains, lakes, rivers, farmland etc
work on map!
smooth out camera centering
add nighttime, a big blanket of darkness
asthetics, consolidate party into one
fix inefficiencies
implement "honor" and baronage?
add minimap
add sphere of influence on minimap


final map goals: 
40 cities
25 castles
10 factions (6 large, 4 small) and bandits
areas bandits spawn, bandit camps kinda like villages?


inefficiencies:
army detect nearby
party check upgrade


MAP info: one big polygon! run a basic line of sight algorithm on it to create visibility graph, then simply do a* to do pathfinding.

World goal: 
The player inhabits a vast kingdom comprised of many factions of various sizes, each controlling
their own sets of locations including cities, castles and villages. Each faction is trying to maximize
their own influence and wealth by conquering more territory and trading. Factions at war develop bitter
rivalries, factions at peace forge uneasy alliances. Bandits and thieves raid trade routes and farmers, 
and rogue rebel factions occassionally arise. Noblemen command sizable parties to attack other factions
and defend their own, while bandit warlords can rise up to challenge them. 
(think about adding a "party level" as parties win more and more battles?)

AI goal: (requires a lot of 'tuning')
A full automated thriving economy exists, and the gameworld should be able to run without player
interaction for days without imbalance occurring. Powerful empires should fall given enough time,
and new ones should rise up to take their place. Factions, cities, and parties on average should 
have an average wealth that remains generally the same, with some getting very rich and some very poor.

Gameplay goal:
Begin by leading a ragtag band of soldiers, trying to gain wealth, fame, and power. 
As you, their leader, become more respected and capable, your party can grow stronger. By honing your party,
you can try taking on bigger and stronger targets, determining your relation with various factions.
Once strong enough, you can take your shot at capturing a city or town. Then you can create your own faction
and declare yourself as king. Other factions will take notice and may react violently, opening up opportunities
for more expansion or annihilation. You should be able to organize your own merchants, patrols, siege parties,
etc.

army types and purposes:
    Farmers - created at villages, farm to gather wealth for cities and villages
    (Village Patrol) - patrols around villages when they become wealthy enough
    
    Merchants - created at cities, trade between cities to gather wealth for cities
    Patrol - created at cities, patrol around cities when wealthy enough

    (Travelers)
    (Pilgrims)
    (Monks)
    (Scouts)
    (Horsemen)

    (annoying Noblemen & their parties) fight each other, raid villages, and besiege cities
        (King) (150+?)
        Archduke
        Prince
        Duke (100+)
